This is to be a remake of my ICS4U culminating project. That project has amalgamated too mush trash and unstructured code for me to bother with and frankly I'm scared to touch it.

Since i created that project over a year ago I have learned many new techniques for creating a more flexible workspace with better, more readable conventions although documentation still needs work...

The biggest difference will be the graphics and physics, as the general game idea will stay the same but this will allow me to expand it much further.

This project will consist of
-Graphics drawn in traditional OpenGL, through LWJGL, eventually taking advantage of GLSL to write shaders.
-Music/Sounds (possibly with OpenAL)
-A better physics engine
	-Ships now have simulated thrusters, each independant of eachother, possibly to be destroyed or malfunction causing realistic driving issues
	-Ships will have other modules that can be damaged that affect their behaviour and cause malfunctions
	-Ships will no longer go through eachother, instead will 'bounce' 
	-Some weapons will have kinetic force
-Multiplayer over wifi 
-Single player survival mode
-Ship creation?
